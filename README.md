Concrete5 MATOMO plugin

Add the MATOMO add-on block to your web sites **Stacks & Global Areas** > **Global Areas** to one of the defined 
global areas. I'd recommend a global area at the web page bottom, or - as it's best to remember - the 
first or the last of the global areas. I prefer the last global area.

The add-on holds two entry fields:
* the MATOMO system's URL without leading http:// or https://
* site ID from the target MATOMO system

Adding the MATOMO add-on block more than once is not helpful, but it wouldn't mess up your pages.
